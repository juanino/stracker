# stracker
Motion tracker that pushes data to graphite

# Why
Project created to track movements of a small child who has trouble sleeping at night.  A personal "sleep study" if you will. 
Intended to provide a framework for tracking those movements in graphite and eventually alerting on movements that might be dangerous
(sleep walking near the stairs or an exterior door).
